# WorshipOn (worshipon)

Saw this hackathon at the last minute and put this together as a starting point last night. Untested.

This project has been initiated following the steps laid out on https://medium.com/quasar-framework/creating-a-quasar-framework-application-with-aws-amplify-services-part-1-4-9a795f38e16d

So not repeating the Amplify steps here. If you want to initiate the amplify build, you will need an AWS account and follow the instructions for initiating amplify.  It will cost you approximately $1/day it running.


## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for dev on AWS
```bash
amplify configure (follow steps above)
amplify init
amplify push
amplify publish
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
